# IR Documents Analysis
## Project Overview:
### Preparing files:
* Created our set of relevant files via the query "search engine bias", and downloaded 50 papers from Google scholar.
* Pre-processed the files with removing non-desirable characters, case-folding, lemmatization, stemming.. etc, and compared the results.
### Classification Task:
* Got 50 random papers from colleagues' directories.
* Performed pre-processing, created a dataframe representation of tokens/files, labeled ours as relevant and colleagues' as non-relevant.
* Ran multiple classification algorithms.
### Clustering Task:
* Got 50 files from 3 chosen directories.
* Performed pre-processing, created a dataframe representation of tokens/files, labeled each file with the query of its original directory.
* Ran Kmeans clustering algorithm.
#### In each task, we provided an analysis for the result.
